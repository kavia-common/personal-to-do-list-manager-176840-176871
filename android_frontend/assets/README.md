# Splashscreen Web Assets

This folder contains standalone HTML/CSS/JS assets for validating a Figma-derived Splashscreen:
- splashscreen-1-2.html
- splashscreen-1-2.css
- splashscreen-1-2.js

Notes:
- These files are not part of the Android build; they are design reference artifacts.
- The Android project root is the parent directory (contains settings.gradle.dcl, gradlew, and module directories).
- Image assets referenced use exact paths under /assets/figmaimages/ as provided.
