Splashscreen assets usage:

1) Open splashscreen-1-2.html in a browser to verify the pixel-perfect layout:
   Path: personal-to-do-list-manager-176840-176871/android_frontend/assets/splashscreen-1-2.html

2) All images are referenced via exact JSON paths under /assets/figmaimages/.
   Example: /assets/figmaimages/figma_image_1_10.svg

3) CSS and JS are linked relatively in the same folder:
   - splashscreen-1-2.css
   - splashscreen-1-2.js

4) These files are static and do not participate in the Android Gradle build.

5) If an automated analyzer cannot detect the Gradle project root, run builds using:
   - bash personal-to-do-list-manager-176840-176871/run-android-gradle.sh :app:assembleDebug
   or change directory:
   - cd personal-to-do-list-manager-176840-176871/android_frontend && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
