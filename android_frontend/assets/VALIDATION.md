Splashscreen (screen_1:2) — Validation Guide

What was delivered
- Pixel-approximate Splashscreen based on screen_1:2.json and screen_1-2.png.
- Files:
  - splashscreen-1-2.html
  - splashscreen-1-2.css
  - splashscreen-1-2.js
  - index.html (preview launcher)
- Image references: EXACT paths from JSON (e.g., /assets/figmaimages/figma_image_1_10.svg)

How to validate locally (no Gradle needed)
1) Open personal-to-do-list-manager-176840-176871/android_frontend/assets/index.html in a browser.
2) Compare to attachments/screen_1-2.png.
3) Verify:
   - Status bar shows “9:30 PM” with WiFi/Signal/Battery icons.
   - Illustration area displays layered SVG vectors.
   - Texts:
     - Heading: “Gets things with TODs”
     - Paragraph with lorem ipsum
   - CTA button “Get Started” centered, 380x60.
   - Subtle fade-in animation on load.

Notes
- These assets are standalone and not compiled by the Android build system.
- Absolute image paths follow the JSON requirement: /assets/figmaimages/...
- Do not move or rename images or files; paths must remain the same for fidelity.
