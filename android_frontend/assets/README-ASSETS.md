# UI Assets (Design Validation)

This folder contains standalone web assets for design validation, unrelated to the Android build pipeline.

Files:
- splashscreen-1-2.html
- splashscreen-1-2.css
- splashscreen-1-2.js

Images used reference the exact Figma-exported paths under `/assets/figmaimages/`.

Open `splashscreen-1-2.html` in a browser to preview the Splashscreen layout.
